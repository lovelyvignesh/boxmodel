      Photography is the process of creating still or moving pictures by
      recording radiation on a sensitive medium like film or an electronic
      sensor. The products of photography are called negatives and photographs,
      the latter being developed from the negatives.the art or process of producing images by the action of radiant energy and especially light on a sensitive surface (such as film or an optical sensor).Photography is important because we can document something and have it forever. Photography lets us see something we may never have noticed otherwise.<br> Photography is a way to express your ideas for others to see. There is no way to deny that life flies by.

      For photography, writing always has to start from what is in the pictures.
      I'll say it again: If what you're writing about is not in the pictures
      you're in trouble (even if the writing sounds so good). That being said,
      don't write about what's in the pictures. Do not describe your
      photographs.
      <br>Most people would agree that art is sketching, drawing, painting, sculpture, installation, and mixed media. In recent years, the Art world has embraced photography as a medium that people can use to create works of art. Yet, not all photographs are considered art.
